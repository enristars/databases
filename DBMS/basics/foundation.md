# Introduction to Database Management Systems
Databases are a crucial aspect for today's world. When we purchase stuff online, when we create a new account on a website or book a flight, you're creating new data. Data is stored in a warehouse of data called database. This database has all the information you provide to the applications you were interacting with. Websites create algorithms to process that data and see what can be done with it: this processing of data means companies will make sense of it, and eventually transform this data into information. This information can be accessed and processed for several reasons, but the underlying purpose is to make business with it, generally speaking.

Data is defined as known facts that can be recorded that have implicit meaning.
Information is defined as data that is processed, organized, structured or presented in a given context.
DBMS is defined as a computerized record keeping system. It is a repository or container for a collection of computerized data files (Vidhya, 2016).
# Structure of a DBMS
According to Vidhya, a DBMS is a software package, which translates data from its logical representation to its physical representation and vice versa.
A database is created using a description by a database designer from their conceptual view of the database, which is called "Conceptual Schema". It then passes the information to the Database Description. But it cannot do that by itself, a manual process needs to be done by the designer, and the way he does that is by using a Data Definition Language, or a graphiscal or text design interface. Once this task is completed, that will become the Database Management System that the user can use.

Conceptual Schema -> Data Definition Language or Interface -> Database Description -> DBMS -> User's view of Database

A Data Definition Language is a sub-set of SQL. It is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database. These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc.
# Classification of DBMS
DBMS can be classified into passive DBMS and active DBMS.
